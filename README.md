# Issue Workflow Explorer (IWE)
Resolving issues is an essential part of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) development. For large and active projects, there could be hundreds of new issues reported every month, which have mixed quality. To deal with this complexity, the projects developed their protocols of resolving issues (i.e., issue workflows) adapting to the changing environment. To help understand and develop best practices, it's important to explore how the workflow evolves in the history, e.g., a particular workflow emerges under what circumstances, how efficient it is and whether it can be improved. We build Issue Workflow Explorer (IWE) to help practitioners seek answers. Based on ubiquitous records in issue tracking system, IWE provides functionalities of discovering workflows, quantifying, visualizing and comparing their efficiency. We demonstrate IWE's effectiveness in two large OSS projects, Mozilla and GNOME. We explore what practices there are for issue triaging and handling of incomplete issue report. We obtain helpful insights for future development, e.g., triage conducted by reporters themselves should be restricted and there is no obvious benefit to keep incomplete issue reports open.
